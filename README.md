This repository contains a MATLAB function that exhibits unexpected behavior due to a subtle error in its conditional logic. The function `myFunction` aims to return the square of the input if the input is greater than 10 and the input otherwise. However, it produces inconsistent results. The `bug.m` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.
